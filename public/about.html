  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <img src="../assets/images/me.jpg" alt="Photo of Olga" width="200">

  <p>Приветствую! My name is Olga, and I'm a Russian-born language enthusiast currently residing in the vibrant land of
    South Africa. With 22 years of experience as a technical editor in a scientific publishing house, I've developed a
    keen eye for detail and a passion for crafting clear, concise language. Now, I'm embarking on an exciting new
    chapter
    in my professional journey – web development.</p>

  <p>My fascination with technology and the endless possibilities of the digital world has inspired me to pursue a
    career
    in web development. I'm eager to combine my linguistic expertise with technical skills to create engaging and
    user-friendly websites.</p>

  <p>When I'm not immersed in the world of words and code, I enjoy spending time with my son, a young man of 25 who
    shares
    my love for cats, detective stories, and the soothing melodies of lo-fi music. These shared passions bring us closer
    and provide a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.</p>

  <p>As I delve into the dynamic realm of web development, I'm committed to bringing my meticulous approach, creative
    spirit, and lifelong love of learning to every project. I believe that technology, when wielded with care and
    purpose,
    can bridge gaps, foster understanding, and enrich our lives.</p>

  <p>I'm excited to connect with you and explore the possibilities that lie ahead.</p>
